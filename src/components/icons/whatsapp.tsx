/**
 * The WhatsApp mark.
 *
 * lucide-react carries no brand glyphs, so this is the official mark's own
 * geometry — the handset inside a speech bubble, tail on the lower left.
 *
 * It was previously drawn by hand from memory. The proportions were close but
 * not right: the bubble was rounder than the real one and the tail sat too high,
 * which is the kind of wrongness that is hard to name and easy to see. A brand
 * mark is recognised by its silhouette, so an approximation of it is not a
 * smaller version of the logo — it is a different logo.
 *
 * Filled rather than stroked, deliberately. Everything else in the footer's
 * social row is a lucide outline at 1.4 weight, and an outlined approximation of
 * this mark stops reading as WhatsApp: it is recognised by its silhouette, and
 * hollowing it out throws that away.
 *
 * This is now the only WhatsApp mark on the site. The floating button used to
 * draw its own stroked one, annotated "not WhatsApp's brand shape" — so the
 * same brand appeared twice, in two shapes, neither of them the real one.
 *
 * Inherits `currentColor`, so it takes the same hover treatment as its
 * neighbours and needs no colour of its own.
